<span data-i18n="Ye Chen_1">Ye Chen is a PhD student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University. His research focuses on brain-like visual decoding, analyzing multimodal neural data (fMRI, electrophysiological, and calcium signals) across various species including mice, salamanders, monkeys, and humans using deep learning techniques. He successfully reconstructs natural visual stimuli from key brain regions such as the visual cortex, midbrain, and thalamus. He has published first-author research in PLOS Computational Biology titled "Decoding dynamic visual scenes across the brain hierarchy." He is dedicated to advancing next-generation brain-inspired intelligence and brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies through a deeper understanding of biological visual pathways.</span>
