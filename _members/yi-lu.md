<span data-i18n="Yi Lu_1">I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Beihang University and am currently pursuing a master's degree at the School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University. I have a strong interest in computational neuroscience and have previously conducted research on bio-inspired models and nervous system behavior simulation. Currently, my primary research focus is on the efficient training and optimization of temporal-coded Spiking Neural Networks.</span>
